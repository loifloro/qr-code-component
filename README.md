### What I learned

I learned in this activity how to properly center a div using flex to its parent and margin: auto to its child element. 

```css
body {
    background: $light-gray;
    font-family: Outfit, sans-serif;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
.card {
    background: $white;
    max-width: 300px;
    border-radius: 1rem;
    padding: 1rem;
    margin: auto;
}
```
